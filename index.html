        <h2>Three Traits That Define Me:</h2>
     		<div class="column-left">
     		  <img src="img/creative.png" alt="">
     		  <h3>Creative</h3>
     		  <p>
     		    I put my creative energy into everything I make, be it an illustration, a piece of writing, comic, or website. I like to utilize and show the wide variety of skills I've obtained, using any tools available.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter what I do, I want to always challenge myself and test my limits, to improve and make any level of progress.
          </p>

     		<div class="column-center">
     		  <img src="img/resourceful.png" alt="">
     		  <h3>Resourceful</h3>
     		  <p>
            I enjoy facing and attacking new challenges, finding out new processes and ideas, and collaborating with others. When I am faced with an obstacle, it's an opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and seek help from available resources and peers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Expanding one's resources can bring new insight, new ideas, and a new outlook.

        <div class="column-right">
     		  <img src="img/curious.png" alt="">
     		  <h3>Curious</h3>
     		  <p>
            I believe that all information is useful, no matter how random it can be. If there is something I don't know about, I am sure to learn about it quickly and put that information I've learned to good use.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a habit of heading over to read a wiki, then realizing a couple hours had passed by because I read a dozen articles on a subject.

        <h2>Things I Would Love to Build:</h2>
        <div class="column-left">
          <img src="img/cms.png" alt="">
          <h3>A Custom CMS for Webcomics</h3>
          <p>
            I want to build my own content management system for comics that isn't a <a href="http://comicpress.org/">template</a> on something like Wordpress. While established CMS solutions can be powerful, I believe there is also power in simplicity. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I want to build a decent CMS that is able to adjust it's format depending on the comic you're making, be it a daily strip to a hundred page graphic novel, and be simple to use without accidentally fiddling with settings that can break the entire thing.
          </p>

        <div class="column-center">
          <img src="img/idea_app.png" alt="">
          <h3>An App to Organize and Break Down My Ideas</h3>
          <p>
            I have numerous apps and devices to create my ideas in, but while they are all stored in my DropBox, as a visual person I'd like to see how all these ideas connect together and link them on the fly with a few finger swipes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the ability to link ideas, there is potential there that you can scramble those connections to gain new ones. Basically, I want to make what can be considered "<a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> for illustrators".

          <h3>A Puzzle Game</h3>
          <p>
            I love playing video games, and have tried making them using game engines like <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2">Construct 2</a>, but I would like to code them from scratch using HTML5 technologies to learn new programming skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            A game I would like to deconstruct and rebuild is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon's_Key">Solomon's Key</a>". While it's not my favorite game, I think it's simple and complicated enough that I could learn a lot, and perhaps make improvements to it's gameplay.
